//! # triple_accel
//!
//! Rust edit distance routines accelerated using SIMD. Supports fast Hamming, Levenshtein,
//! restricted Damerau-Levenshtein, etc. distance calculations and string search.
//!
//! Although vectorized SIMD code allows for up to 20-30x speedups over their scalar counterparts,
//! the difficulty of handling platform-dependent SIMD code makes SIMD routines less attractive.
//! The goal of this library is to provide an easy-to-use abstraction over SIMD edit distance routines
//! that fall back to scalar routines if the target CPU architecture is not supported.
//! Additionally, all limitations and tradeoffs of the edit distance routines should be provided upfront
//! so the user knows exactly what to expect.
//! Finally, this library should lead to performance boosts on both short and longer strings, so it
//! can be used for a variety of tasks, from bioinformatics to natural language processing.
//! `triple_accel` is very lightweight: it only has dependencies on other crates for benchmarking.
//! It can be built on machines without CPUs that have AVX2 or SSE4.1 support. It can also run on
//! machines without SIMD support by automatically using scalar alternatives.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! This library provides routines for both searching for some needle string in a haystack string
//! and calculating the edit distance between two strings. Hamming distance (mismatches only),
//! Levenshtein distance (mismatches + gaps), and restricted Damerau-Levenshtein distance
//! (transpositions + mismatches + gaps) are supported, along with arbitrary edit costs. This
//! library provides a simple interface, in addition to powerful lower-level control over the edit
//! distance calculations.
//!
//! At runtime, the implementation for a certain algorithm is selected based on CPU support, going
//! down the list:
//!
//! 1. Vectorized implementation with 256-bit AVX vectors, if AVX2 is supported.
//! 2. Vectorized implementation with 128-bit SSE vectors, if SSE4.1 is supported.
//! 3. Scalar implementation.
//!
//! Currently, vectorized SIMD implementations are only available for x86 or x86-64 CPUs. However,
//! after compiling this library on a machine that supports those SIMD intrinsics, the library can
//! be used on other machines.
//! Additionally, the internal data structure for storing vectors and the bit width of the values
//! in the vectors are selected at runtime for maximum efficiency and accuracy, given the lengths
//! of the input strings.
//!
//! ## Limitations
//!
//! Due to the use of SIMD intrinsics, only binary strings that are represented with `u8` bytes
//! are supported. Unicode strings are not currently supported.
//!
//! ## Notation
//!
//! Quick notation notes that will often appear in the code/documentation:
//!
//! * `k` - the number of edits that are allowed
//! * `a` and `b` - any two strings; this is usually used for edit distance routines
//! * `needle` and `haystack` - any two strings; we want to search for where needle appears in
//! haystack
//!
//! ## Examples
//! Calculating the Hamming distance (number of mismatches) between two strings is extremely simple:
//! ```
//! use triple_accel::*;
//!
//! let a = b"abcd";
//! let b = b"abcc";
//!
//! let dist = hamming(a, b);
//! assert!(dist == 1);
//! ```
//! By default, SIMD will be used if possible. Similarly, we can easily calculate the Levenshtein
//! distance (character mismatches and gaps all have a cost of 1) between two strings with the
//! following code:
//! ```
//! use triple_accel::*;
//!
//! let a = b"abc";
//! let b = b"abcd";
//!
//! let dist = levenshtein_exp(a, b);
//! assert!(dist == 1);
//! ```
//! In addition to edit distance routines, `triple_accel` also provides search routines. These
//! routines return an iterator over matches that indicate where the `needle` string matches the `haystack`
//! string. `triple_accel` will attempt to maximize the length of matches that end at the same position.
//! ```
//! use triple_accel::*;
//!
//! let needle = b"helllo";
//! let haystack = b"hello world";
//!
//! let matches: Vec<Match> = levenshtein_search(needle, haystack).collect();
//! // note: start index is inclusive, end index is exclusive!
//! assert!(matches == vec![Match{start: 0, end: 5, k: 1}]);
//! ```
//! Sometimes, it is necessary to use the slightly lower level, but also more powerful routines
//! that `triple_accel` provides. For example, it is possible to allow transpositions (character swaps)
//! that have a cost of 1, in addition to mismatches and gaps:
//! ```
//! use triple_accel::levenshtein::*;
//!
//! let a = b"abcd";
//! let b = b"abdc";
//! let k = 2; // upper bound on allowed cost
//! let trace_on = false; // return edit traceback?
//!
//! let dist = levenshtein_simd_k_with_opts(a, b, k, trace_on, RDAMERAU_COSTS);
//! // note: dist may be None if a and b do not match within a cost of k
//! assert!(dist.unwrap().0 == 1);
//! ```
//! Don't let the name of the function fool you! `levenshtein_simd_k_with_opts` will still fall back to
//! the scalar implementation if AVX2 or SSE4.1 support is not available. It just prefers to use SIMD
//! where possible.
//!
//! For most common cases, the re-exported functions are enough, and the low level functions do not
//! have to be used directly.
